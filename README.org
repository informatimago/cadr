* CADR Lisp Machine Simulator

This is a fork of the CADR simulator, originally [[http://www.unlambda.com/cadr/][by Brad Parker]][1] and as
modified [[https://github.com/joshuaeckroth/cadr][by Joshua Eckroth]][2].  This fork contains the .img and .bin files
which are missing from Eckroth's version, and fixes a bug on OS X.  The origin
of this project is documented in `create.sh`. (Do not run this script anymore).


The simulator requires SDL and xz to build.  On macOS, it may be the
SDL library obtained from `MacPort`:

#+begin_src bas
sudo port install libsdl
#+end_src

installed in `/opt/local/include` and `/opt/local/lib`.


To make it go, run `make` followed by `./cadr`.
