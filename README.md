# CADR Lisp Machine Simulator

This is a fork of the CADR simulator, originally [by Brad Parker][1] and as
modified [by Joshua Eckroth][2]. This fork contains the .img and .bin files
which are missing from Eckroth's version, and fixes a bug on OS X. The origin
of this project is documented in `create.sh`.

The simulator requires SDL and xz to build.

To make it go, run `make` followed by `./cadr`.
